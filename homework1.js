// 1 Using string concatenation add two different strings together and print this off
console.log("my name is ibrahim")

// 3 Using string concatenation in javascript combine 3 different variables and prints it off. I.e variable for name age and date of birth will result in “my name is abdulkadir I am 24 years old and I was born in 1998”. (you cannot use name age and dob as your variables).
const dob = "12/10/1994";
let age = 29;

console.log("Hello my my name Ibrahim " + " i and i am " + age + " years old" + " and i was born " + dob + " in  summer time" )
// 4 Create a variable that is printed off then changed further down the script and printed.

console.log (age) 

age = 25;

console.log (age) 
// 5 Print off the datatypes for a number variable & string variable.
